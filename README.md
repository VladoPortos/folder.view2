# FolderView2 For Unraid 7

## What is FolderView2?

Original creator: [**scolcipitato**](https://github.com/scolcipitato/folder.view)

FolderView2 lets you create folders for grouping Dockers and VMs together to help with organization. Especially useful if you're using docker-compose.
Getting Started: A new button named "Add Folder" will appear at the bottom of the docker/VM tab next to "Add Container/VM".

## Installation

Manual for now, need to figure out how to submit to Unraid app store.

### Backup
If you already have this plugins older version setup go to Plugins -> FolderView and "Export All" your current settings!

However if you arelady can't access FolderView go to Settings via UI, go to:

`config\plugins\folder.view\` and backup: `docker.json` and `vm.json` 

```bash
root@PlexServer:/boot/config/plugins/folder.view# pwd
/boot/config/plugins/folder.view
root@PlexServer:/boot/config/plugins/folder.view# ls
docker.json  folder.view2-2025.02.26.txz  scripts/  styles/  version  vm.json
root@PlexServer:/boot/config/plugins/folder.view# 
```

### Easy Manual installation

Use link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VladoPortos/folder.view2/refs/heads/main/folder.view2.plg

That link can be posted directly into the plugin install without needing to copy it to the filesystem beforehand.
